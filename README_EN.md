## 4.Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Build Type Errors**ÔºöThere are many type-check escape declarations in the project, mainly because after switching to a new computer, developers frequently encountered type errors when running `yarn build`. However, the project itself has no issues, so they had to adopt type-check escape methods to run the project.
- üí¨ **Chat Usage**Ôºö The homepage defaults to a general model. Switch masks or shortcut assistants to interact with the AI Emotion Assistant. 
- üé® **Drawing Feature**ÔºöThe project‚Äôs **Discover** module also includes a drawing feature, where you can import the corresponding API for use.

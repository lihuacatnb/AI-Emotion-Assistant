## 4.Notes
- ⚠️ **Build Type Errors**：There are many type-check escape declarations in the project, mainly because after switching to a new computer, developers frequently encountered type errors when running `yarn build`. However, the project itself has no issues, so they had to adopt type-check escape methods to run the project.
- 💬 **Chat Usage**： The homepage defaults to a general model. Switch masks or shortcut assistants to interact with the AI Emotion Assistant. 
- 🎨 **Drawing Feature**：The project’s **Discover** module also includes a drawing feature, where you can import the corresponding API for use.
